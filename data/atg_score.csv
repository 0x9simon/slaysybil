The Gitcoin Sybil Slaying Hackathon was concerned more about the novelty of the idea, the significance of the features discovered, and the clarity of the approaches (with the help of good visualizations) . To avoid possible confusion and misunderstandings, we choose to hide the output lists of suspicious Sybils formally presented in the folder (It is not a main point of the Hackathon) . But, if you are full of curiousity about the output of your personal address, follow trustalabs on Twitter for a query :-)
